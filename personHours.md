# ⏱️ Person-Hours Tracking

This document tracks both the **estimates** and **actual accounting** of team member hours.

# 1. Estimate of Person-Hours (Methodology)

For this project, we applied the **Expert Judgment** method. This is the simplest and most common estimation approach: an experienced team member provides estimates based on prior work on similar programming assignments and projects. The goal is to define **standardized hour ranges for each type of task** so that workload can be consistently broken down across the team.

---

## 📊 Standard Estimation Guidelines

- **Design & Planning**  
  Includes initial requirements review, architecture design, and task breakdown.  
  _Estimated effort:_ **6–8 hours** (team total)

- **Coding / Implementation**  
  Writing and integrating the BoardManager, GameLogic, and UI components, plus wiring up input handling.  
  _Estimated effort:_ **4–6 hours per major component** (≈ 15–20 hours total for the team)

- **Testing & Debugging**  
  Unit testing, edge case handling (e.g., first-click safety, recursive uncover), and bug fixing.  
  _Estimated effort:_ **2–3 hours per component** (≈ 8–10 hours total for the team)

- **Documentation**  
  README, system architecture overview, prologue comments, and inline documentation.  
  _Estimated effort:_ **5–6 hours total**

- **Meetings & Coordination**  
  Weekly syncs, planning discussions, and check-ins with GTA/team.  
  _Estimated effort:_ **3–4 hours per week** (~10–12 hours over project duration)

## 📋 Roll-Up Estimate

| Task Category       | Estimated Hours |
| ------------------- | --------------- |
| Design & Planning   | 6–8             |
| Coding              | 15–20           |
| Testing & Debugging | 8–10            |
| Documentation       | 5–6             |
| Meetings            | 10–12           |
| **Total**           | **45–56 hrs**   |

---

## ✅ Justification

By using **Expert Judgment**, we leverage past experience with similar class projects and break down the work into standard categories. These ranges make it easy to compare **planned vs. actual hours** later and provide a clear methodology that the GTA and Project 2 team can follow.

# 2. Actual Accounting

A **day-by-day accounting per member**, including hours spent on coding, testing, meetings, and documentation.  
Excluding EECS 581 lecture time.
