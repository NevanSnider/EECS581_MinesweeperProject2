# ‚è±Ô∏è Person-Hours Tracking

This document tracks both the **estimates** and **actual accounting** of team member hours.

# 1. Estimate of Person-Hours (Methodology)

For this project, we applied the **Expert Judgment** method. This is the simplest and most common estimation approach: an experienced team member provides estimates based on prior work on similar programming assignments and projects. The goal is to define **standardized hour ranges for each type of task** so that workload can be consistently broken down across the team.

---

## üìä Standard Estimation Guidelines

- **Design & Planning**  
  Includes initial requirements review, architecture design, and task breakdown.  
  _Estimated effort:_ **6‚Äì8 hours** (team total)

- **Coding / Implementation**  
  Writing and integrating the BoardManager, GameLogic, and UI components, plus wiring up input handling.  
  _Estimated effort:_ **4‚Äì6 hours per major component** (‚âà 15‚Äì20 hours total for the team)

- **Testing & Debugging**  
  Unit testing, edge case handling (e.g., first-click safety, recursive uncover), and bug fixing.  
  _Estimated effort:_ **2‚Äì3 hours per component** (‚âà 8‚Äì10 hours total for the team)

- **Documentation**  
  README, system architecture overview, prologue comments, and inline documentation.  
  _Estimated effort:_ **5‚Äì6 hours total**

- **Meetings & Coordination**  
  Weekly syncs, planning discussions, and check-ins with GTA/team.  
  _Estimated effort:_ **3‚Äì4 hours per week** (~10‚Äì12 hours over project duration)

## üìã Roll-Up Estimate

| Task Category       | Estimated Hours |
| ------------------- | --------------- |
| Design & Planning   | 6‚Äì8             |
| Coding              | 15‚Äì20           |
| Testing & Debugging | 8‚Äì10            |
| Documentation       | 5‚Äì6             |
| Meetings            | 10‚Äì12           |
| **Total**           | **45‚Äì56 hrs**   |

## ‚úÖ Justification

By using **Expert Judgment**, we leverage past experience with similar class projects and break down the work into standard categories. These ranges make it easy to compare **planned vs. actual hours** later and provide a clear methodology that the GTA and Project 2 team can follow.

# 2. Actual Accounting

A **day-by-day accounting per member**, including hours spent on coding, testing, meetings, and documentation.  
Excluding EECS 581 lecture time.
